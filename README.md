# Personal Website - Matthew Sam

# Purpose
In this personal website I have my previous projects and reports. I also have links to my LinkedIn, Resume, the Midterm Project and listed my previous internship experiences. I also have an about me section and a hobbies section, describing a little more about myself and what I enjoy doing as a hobby.
